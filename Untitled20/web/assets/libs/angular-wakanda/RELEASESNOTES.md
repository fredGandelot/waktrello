## v1.1.0

Angular-Wakanda now relies on [Wakanda-Client](https://github.com/Wakanda/wakanda-javascript-client) instead of WAF to perform communication with Wakanda Server's REST API.
Angular-Wakanda API have been simplified, removing some old buggy methods, and other that could be ambiguous.

### New features

* Server methods that returns collection or entities now directly return Angular-Wakanda collections or entities. No need to call `$transform` helpers methods anymore.
* Add `$recompute` method, to execute server-side logic (calculated attributes computation, `init` and `clientrefresh` events) on a local entity
* Entity method `$isDeferred()` has been added, to check if an entity has been fetched or is deferred

### API simplification

* `$serverRefresh()` has been deleted. Deprecated since v1.0.2
* `$transform.$objectToEntity()` is now deprecated, call to this method can be safely removed, as the transformation is automatic
* `$transform.$objectToCollection()` is now deprecated, call to this method can be safely removed, as the transformation is automatic
* Entity and collection attribute `$fetching` has been removed
* Collection attribute `$queryParams.filter` has been removed
* Parameter `mode` has been removed from collection `$fetch()` method. `$fetch()` always replace the collection content. To append more content to a collection, use `$more()` method.
* Entity method `$isLoaded()` has been removed

## v1.0.4

* Collection user defined methods are now available on every collections (queried, fetched and expanded)
